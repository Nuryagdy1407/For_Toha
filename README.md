## Don't understand the game? Here is introduction â¬‡
Up to 8 teams can take part in the intellectual game Brain-Ring (a Brain game). Each team consists of four or more players which organize a team on their own during the conference. The game is divided into rounds. In each round, the moderator of the game asks one question. If this question was prepared by a team then this team does not participate in the round, and the question is asked for the other teams. Then the teams discuss the question and prepare the answer. Using the answers the moderator calculates the scores earned by each team in this round of the game. The round ends when the moderator receives the correct answer or after 3 incorrect answers. In total, there are at least 10 questions from the organizers of the game and 6 questions from each team. The team that scores the maximum number of points wins the game.
